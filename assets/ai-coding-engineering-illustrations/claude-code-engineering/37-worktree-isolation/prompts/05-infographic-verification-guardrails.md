Layout: one central shield surrounded by four independent verification gates.

ZONES:
- Center: protected execution boundary represented by a simple shield and check mark
- Upper left: permission gate represented by a keyhole icon
- Upper right: evidence gate represented by a document-and-check icon
- Lower left: isolation gate represented by nested boxes
- Lower right: recovery gate represented by a curved return arrow

CONNECTIONS: thin dashed lines connect each gate to the central shield; no arrows cross.

VISIBLE LABELS (render these exact short Chinese labels clearly; do not invent pseudo-text):
- 清理动作可能删除真实工作
- -p
- git status
- git log
- --resume
- --continue
- 退出交互 worktree 会话时，Claude Code 检查未提交修改、untracked files 和新提交

COLORS:

- Near-black hand-drawn outlines #1A1A1A
- Pastel blue #A8D4F0 for primary emphasis
- Pastel yellow #F9E79F for transition or caution

STYLE: GPT Image illustration in a polished Notion-like editorial style. White background, hand-drawn black line art, rounded modular cards, sparse pastel fills, subtle paper texture, soft shadows, generous whitespace, simple conceptual icons, no logos, no photorealism, no robots, no decorative scenery. Include only the supplied concise Chinese labels; typography must be clear, correctly spelled, and integrated into the information hierarchy. Create a distinct composition tailored to this section; do not imitate a repeated local template.
ASPECT: 16:9, clean knowledge-card composition.
